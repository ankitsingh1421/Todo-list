# ToDo List with HTML, CSS, , JavaScript and Bootstrap

This project demonstrates how to create a simple ToDo list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and dynamically change the ToDo list's name. The data is stored locally using the browser's localStorage.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Todo list .html` file in a web browser.
3. You'll see a default ToDo list with the title "ToDo List".
4. To add a new task, type the task into the input field at the top of the page and press Enter or click the "Add Task" button.
5. To delete a task, right-click on the task item and select "Delete" from the context menu.
6. To change the title of the ToDo list, click the "Change Title" button and enter the new title in the prompt that appears.
7. Your ToDo list data will be saved locally using the browser's localStorage, so you can close the browser and reopen it later to find your tasks still intact.
